# Code quality analysis

## Metrics

For each characteristic we compute what percentage of the code is above the threshold. Then a rank is computed for that characteristic. For each Maintainability attribute we compute the average rank (based on its corresponding code characteristics).

Code characteristic         | Metric                               | Threshold | Maintainability attr.
----------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------|----------------------
Module size                 | SLOC                                 |  <=400    | ADT
Class complexity            | Cyclomatic per method: average; max  |  <10; <20 | DT
Class design (for OO)       | WMC                                  |  <=20     | MRAD
Module design (for non OO)  | Functions per module/file            |  <=20     | MRAD
Module internal duplication | % of duplicated SLOC inside modules  |  N/A      | RAD
Code commenting             | % LOCM                               |  >15%     | A
Cyclic dependencies         | # of between classes                 |  0        | MRADT
Module coupling             | CBO                                  |  <16      | MR
Module external duplication | % of duplicated SLOC between modules |  N/A      | MR

rank    |    % of modules/classes/packages above threshold
--------|-------------------------------------------------
+2      |    0-3%
+1      |    4-5%
0       |    6-10%
-1      |    11-20%
-2      |    21â€“100%

Code | Maintainability attribute
-----|--------------------------
M    | Modularity
R    | Reusability
A    | Analyzability
D    | Modifiability
T    | Testability

TU/e uses [simian](http://www.harukizaemon.com/simian/index.html/) to analyse code duplication.
[understand](http://scitools.com/student) is used to derive all the other metrics.
These tools are gui based and do not integrate well with Github.
We will be useing [super-linter](https://github.com/super-linter/super-linter). Which combines different languague specific linters to analyse code.

**Note:** check before submission that *simian* and *understand* also return positive metrics
